                    1 1/2 tablespoons of butter
                </li>
                <li>
                    2 shallots, minced

                <li>
                    1 cup heavy whipping cream
                </li>
                <li>
                    4 cups fresh spinach
                </li>
                <li>
                    1/2 cup Gorgonzola cheese
                </li>
                <li>
                    salt and freshly groudn black pepper to taste

                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook fusilli in boiling water, occasionally
                    stirring, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.</li>
                <li>In the meantime, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat and cook shallots until soft and
                    translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour in cream and cook until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Add
                    spinach and crumble in Gorgonzola cheese. Season with salt and pepper and cook until spinach is
                    wilted and sauce has thickened, about 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Drain fusilli and toss with sauce. Serve immediately.</li>
